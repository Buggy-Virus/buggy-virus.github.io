This website was setup to be a landing page for Oliver Hare (me) for career and professional exposure. It has an [About page][about] and [Contact page][contact] for this reason, these contain general information about myself including a general description, links to relevent sites and accounts, and a CV.

Additionally, this site supports a blog I use to post thoughts on various topics, and projects. The site hosts links to a subset of my computer science and mathematics work, and showcases some of these in their pages.

The site was created using [Jekyll][jekyll] to generate the base site. The original theme was [Minima][minima], and all differences between the most basic Minima site and this site's current form were implemented myself. I designed the look of the site, and wrote all the CSS, HTML, and Liquid of these differences.
