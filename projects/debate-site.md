I made this website for the Brown Debating union a couple years ago. After making it, I handed off updating and maintaining it to someone else, so I wouldn't be surprised if some images are missing, or there are weird things in content sections. That being said, the structure looks generally intact.

The site is pretty simple, only using HTML and CSS styling. It doesn't even have a CSS style sheet, but instead has the style defined on each page. It is the first site I ever wrote from scratch.
