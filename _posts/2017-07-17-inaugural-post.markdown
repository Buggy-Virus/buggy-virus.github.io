&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey I'm Oliver Hare, I just pushed my intial Jekyll website using Git-Hub, and this is my first post to test and familiarize myself with the website. Big thanks to Martin Buberl and his fantastic blog on [quickly setting up a page using jekyll][martinbuberl-tutorial].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan for this website is to use it mainly to showcase projects I been working on, and provide a landing page for those who want to see my work or are considering me for a professional position. I'll probably also make way too much use of the blogging feature, and hopefully my posts are interesting for others to read.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's to the future, and keeping a positive attitude.
